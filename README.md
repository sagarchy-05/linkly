# curtli

A URL shortener that **counts clicks in hourly buckets without slowing the redirect down**.

## What it does

You paste a long URL, you get back a short one. So far, nothing unusual.

The interesting part is what happens when somebody **clicks** the short link — because that's where most URL shorteners either give you no analytics, or pay for them with a slow redirect. curtli does neither.

## How click analytics work

### 1. The redirect doesn't wait for the analytics

When `GET /aB3xK9p` comes in, the controller does the minimum work needed to send a `302`:

```
GET /aB3xK9p
   │
   ├─ Resolve long URL    (Redis cache → Postgres fallback)
   ├─ Hand off the click event to an async thread pool   ← non-blocking
   └─ Return 302 Found
```

The handoff is fire-and-forget. If the analytics infrastructure is sick, the redirect still happens in single-digit milliseconds. If the async queue is full, the click is dropped on the floor — analytics is best-effort by design, never load-bearing.

### 2. Clicks go into a Redis Stream, not directly to Postgres

The async worker doesn't write to Postgres. It writes one record to a Redis Stream called `click_events`:

```
XADD click_events * shortCode=aB3xK9p ipHash=… referrer=… ts=…
```

Redis Streams act as a durable buffer with consumer-group semantics. If you scale to multiple app instances, they share work — each replica gets its own slice of the events via its `$HOSTNAME`-derived consumer name.

### 3. A scheduled consumer drains the stream in batches

Every ~1 second (configurable), a `@Scheduled` job runs on every app instance:

```
XREADGROUP curtli-group $HOSTNAME COUNT 1500 BLOCK 250ms
   │
   ▼
ClickAggregator.flush(events)
```

The aggregator does two things, and this is where the cost savings come from.

### 4. Hourly bucketing — N clicks become 1 DB write

Each event has a `shortCode` and a timestamp. The aggregator:

1. **Groups events by `shortCode`** within the batch.
2. **Truncates "now" to the hour** to get a `bucket_hour`.
3. For each `(shortCode, bucket_hour)` pair, issues a Postgres **UPSERT** against `click_stats`:

```sql
INSERT INTO click_stats (link_id, bucket_hour, click_count)
VALUES (:linkId, :bucketHour, :count)
ON CONFLICT (link_id, bucket_hour)
DO UPDATE SET click_count = click_stats.click_count + EXCLUDED.click_count
```

So 500 clicks on the same short link in the same hour produce **one** DB row — and on subsequent flushes within that hour, **one** UPDATE that increments the counter. Not 500 inserts. Not 500 row locks. Not 500 round-trips. One.

The `click_stats` table ends up looking like this:

| link_id | bucket_hour              | click_count |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 42      | 2026-05-17 14:00:00+00   | 1283        |
| 42      | 2026-05-17 15:00:00+00   | 947         |
| 42      | 2026-05-17 16:00:00+00   | 1102        |
| 99      | 2026-05-17 14:00:00+00   | 12          |

Which is exactly what you want for "clicks per hour over the last 24h" charts — no rollup query needed, no scanning a raw events table, just a range scan on `(link_id, bucket_hour DESC)`.

A separate lifetime counter on the `links` table gets the same `+= N` treatment in the same transaction, so the all-time total stays in sync.

### 5. Trade-offs

- **No sub-hour resolution.** If you need "clicks per minute," this design throws that information away. The reasoning: minute-level resolution would mean 60× more rows for a marginal product win.
- **Eventually consistent.** A click registered now shows up in the `click_stats` table on the next consumer tick — typically within 1–2 seconds, never more than a few. The `links.click_count` lifetime total has the same lag.
- **Duplicate-click debounce, not de-dup.** A 10-second Redis `SETNX` per `(shortCode, IP)` collapses retries, double-clicks, browser prefetches, and bot follow-throughs that hit within 10s of each other. It's a heuristic, not perfect — but it's a single Redis round-trip and it knocks out the obvious noise.

## What else it does

- **Custom aliases** — `POST /api/shorten` accepts an optional `customAlias` (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,16}`). Unique-constraint race is handled by attempting the insert and catching the violation, not pre-checking.
- **Bulk shortening** — `POST /api/bulk-shorten` accepts an array, runs each through the same path, and returns a partial-success body so one bad URL doesn't fail the whole batch.
- **Expiry** — `expiresInDays` is validated `1..3650`, cache TTL is bounded by the link's own expiry so a cached entry never outlives the link itself.
- **Rate limiting** — Redis-backed token bucket implemented in a single atomic Lua script. Separate buckets for single (`10/min/IP`) and bulk (env-configurable, default 1 per 5 minutes per IP).
- **Random Base62 short codes** — 7 chars from `SecureRandom`, 62⁷ ≈ 3.5 trillion possible values. Codes are unguessable and the keyspace doesn't visibly leak how many links exist.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:8080/**. Postgres, Redis, and the app come up together; Flyway runs the migrations on first boot.

## API

| Method | Path                  | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------|-------|
| `POST` | `/api/shorten`        | Single shorten. Returns `ShortenResponse`. |
| `POST` | `/api/bulk-shorten`   | Up to 20 URLs. Partial-success response. |
| `GET`  | `/{shortCode}`        | 302 to the long URL (or 404 / 410). |
| `GET`  | `/swagger-ui.html`    | Interactive API docs. |
| `GET`  | `/actuator/prometheus`| Metrics. |

`ShortenRequest`:

```json
{
  "longUrl": "https://example.com/something/long",
  "customAlias": "launch-2026",
  "expiresInDays": 30
}
```

`customAlias` and `expiresInDays` are optional. `expiresInDays` is `null` for permanent links.
